# What is this folder?

React Autocomplete search is currently using for Next.js and Typescript and also Redux.

# problems

- when user hit esc key, suggestion list should be closed and input value should be cleared.
- you should take care of highligting the matched text in suggestion list.
- should use redux for state management for updating input value and suggestion list.
- use hooks like useCallBack, useMemo, etc.
